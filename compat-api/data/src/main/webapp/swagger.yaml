  title: Data web service
  description: >
    The classic CADC data web service.


    The data web service is a helper service that supports downloading files
    from the CADC archive. The call can be anonymous or the caller can authenticate 
    using cookie, tokens, or client (proxy) certificate. 
    
    
    If the specified archive or file is not "public", an anonymous caller will be 
    redirected to an alternate URL that challenges for authentication 
    (username/password login) before proceeding.

        URL that can be used without further authentication. This final download URL may 
        have a limited lifetime so should not be stored for later use.
